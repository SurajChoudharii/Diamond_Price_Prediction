# 💎 Diamond Price Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to accurately predict the prices of diamonds based on key features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and other characteristics.

## 📌 Project Description

The diamond industry is highly data-driven, with price depending on a range of physical attributes. This project leverages Python and popular data science libraries to:

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Preprocess and clean the dataset
- Train various regression models
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like R², MAE, MSE
- Use the best model to predict diamond prices

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

## 📊 Technologies & Tools

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
